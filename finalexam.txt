PSY31170 Winter Session 2019 Final Exam

due  Friday 1/25/2019 by midnight, 
along with all assignments and the class project

1. Fix this expression without changing any numbers,  so x evaluates to 28:
	x = 7 * 2  **2   #note: read the file PythonArithmetic.py for clues

2.  initialize p correctly so it prints 10
p= ???
for x in range(3):
	p = p + x
print(p)

3.  fix the syntax and logic errors in this code snippet so it prints 101
z= true
y=1
while z:
    y+=10
    if y = 100:
        z=false
print(y)

4. Using these variables with the built-in string function str.upper() 
and string slicing,  put an expression into the print statement that 
outputs exactly this:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog named Rover

    s=”the quick brown”
    f=[‘animal’, ‘fox’, ‘puppy’]
    j=’jumps over “Rover” the lazy dog’
   print (?????)
    
5. What command must be executed before you can use the the csv.reader() 
function to read in a text file of values separated by commas?  
Demonstrate by writing a very short program to read in a csv file 
named “data.csv” using the csv.reader() function.

6. Debug this program so it runs correctly:

# finalexamproblem6.py
# Asks user for their information and adds it to a text file 
while True
print(Enter your name,, address and phone, please)
f = open(“textfile.txt”,’w’)
name = ‘input(Your name’)
addr = input’((Your address’)
phone=’input(Your phone)’
f.writelines(name,add,phone)
f.close()
if name=’’:
    break
