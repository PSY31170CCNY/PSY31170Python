# === TO DO: ===
"""
1. Add a user data entry loop to allow more names and emails to be entered.
    Include the entry of the other data attributes of a Person
2. Add more attributes,but leave the data entry for now
3. add a loop to let the user look up an entry by name, and then enter a value
    for another attribute if the dictionary entry is found.
4. After any new data is entered, re-write the csv file to save the data.
