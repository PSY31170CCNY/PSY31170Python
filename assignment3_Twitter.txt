Assignment 3: Twitter processing

1. read in the csv file "saved_tweetsTrump.csv" as a list of fields
Each field is either a list or a text string

2. ask the user to enter a text string to search for, and
a field to look in. e.g. look for "python" in the Tweet text or
look for "U.S." in the location.

3. display all the tweets that contain the requested string.

4. sort the list of tweets by location, alphabetically
   a. list each location and the number of tweets from each location
5. sort the tweets by username. list the users with more than one tweet.

Use the "try - except" structure to catch errors in the data
to ignore or otherwise process:

for tweettext in alltext:
    try:
        x=tweettext.find('asdf')
        print('asdf is at position',x)
    except Exception as e:
        print("oops! error: ", str(e))
	# do something to compensate for the error if possible
        continue # go on to the next line
