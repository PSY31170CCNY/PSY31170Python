How about a nice Game of BlackJack?

Create a simplified simulation of playing blackjack( aka '21')

1. using lists [],
 define a list of suits ("hearts", "spades" etc) and 
a list of cards ['Ace', "King", "Queen", ..."3", "2", "1"]

using two loops, one inside the other, 
create another list that has all the playing cards in a deck:
# initialize the list of cards:
cards=[]
loop of the suits:
   loop of the cards:
     cards.append( xxx ) # note: append is a built-in function of lists

# now, with the new list of 52 playing cards:
import the random module's shuffle() function.
use the shuffle() function to shuffle the deck.
# simulate the playing sequence:

1. the computer is the dealer:
a. select the next 2 cards from the top of the deck.
b. tell the user what they are.
c. ask the user if they want to stay or draw.

d. if they want to draw, give the user another card.
   1) if the user's total is over 21, they lose, so start again.
   2) keep asking until the user says to stay, or the user loses.

e. after the users chooses to stay, the computer selects the next 2 cards from the deck
   1) show the dealers selected cards (NOTE: in this simplified version, the dealer does
      not draw any additional cards.)

f. Calculate the score of the hands:
   1) If the user's total is equal to 21 or closer to  21 than the computer's, the user wins.
   2)The player loses automatically if they draw over 21, without even counting the dealer's hand.
   3) Tell the user the outcome ('you won' or 'you lost')

	Calculating the score of a hand:
	1. Aces can be either 11 points or 1 point when the score of a hand is totalled, 
	so whichever choice creates a higher score that is 21 or less is the value 
	assigned to an Ace. (If more than one Ace is dealt, the earlier ones are 
	designated as 1, and the last one can beii either 1 or 11.
	2. Face cards are 10 points. 
	3. The rest of the cards' scores are their face value.

g. Keep track of how many wins and losses the user gets.

h. the game ends when the entire deck has been drawn or if there are not enough cards
to complete the current hand. 

NOTE: there are additional complexities in the real world version of blackjack, but
this assignment only uses these specified actions, so don't worry about the dealer
drawing more cards.
