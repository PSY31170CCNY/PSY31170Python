How about a nice Game of BlackJack?

using lists [] define a list of suits ("hearts", "spades" etc) and a list of cards ['Ace', "King", "Queen", ..."3", "2", "1"]

using two loop, one inside the other, create another list that has all the playing cards in a deck:
# initialize the list of cards:
cards=[]
loop of the suits:
   loop of the cards:
     cards.append( xxx ) # note: append is a built-in function of lists

# now, with the new list of 52 playing cards:
use the rand() function to shuffle the deck. eg. cards[23]

 the computer is the dealer:
select the next 2 cards from the top of the deck.
tell the user what they are.
ask the user if they want to stay or draw.
if they want to draw, give the user another card.
   if the user's total is over 21, they lose, so start again.
  keep asking until the user says to stay.
the computer selects the next 2 cards from the deck and shows them.
 If the user's total is closer to 21 than the computer's, the user wins.
else the user loses. Keep track of how many wins and losses the user gets.
